# [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)

These projects are part of the Responsive Web Design Certification, where I reviewed and practiced my knowledges about HTML and CSS. Each folder corresponds to a project that I had to do.

I recommend this platform to anyone who want to learn or to practice your knowledge, and you'll find other courses there. Just do it :)

Thanks for your presence here and sorry about my english, I'm learning.
